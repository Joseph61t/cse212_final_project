# Tree Tutorial

## Introduction
 In this tutorial, we will be going over how to make a tree. 

 A tree uses nodes, like the linked list, a node is a data structure that contains a value, and at least one pointer, typically to another node.

 There are several types of trees, from standard ones, to balanced ones, to red black trees. We are just going ot be looking at a standard tree.

 These are the normal operations of a tree, along with their efficiency.

 Operation   | Efficiency
------------|--------------
 Insert | 0(log(n))
 find  | 0(log(n))
 Remove  | 0(log(n)) 



## Usage
Trees are used mostly when you are going to be searching through the data a lot.

## Implementing A Tree
 In this [code](sort-tree.py) I will show how to make a tree. 
 Once you have gone over that code, try and add a find function, that would find the inputed number, and display the number of nodes gone through to find it. (Hint, do it looks simular to the display function.)

 Here is my [version](find-tree.py) of that code.
